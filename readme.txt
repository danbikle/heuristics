~/hr/readme.txt

This repo contains scripts which help me implement a heuristics based
trading strategy.

Typically I clone this repo to my home directory.

Also I typically call the resulting directory ~/hr/

For Postgres, I typically start by loading a new set of prices.

The script I use is listed below:

~/hr/pg/load_ydata.bash
